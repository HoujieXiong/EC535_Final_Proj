Abstract: 
This project presents a smart garden system that automates plant care and offers full remote control. It continuously monitors temperature and humidity, then—either autonomously or at your command—adjusts heating, cooling, or irrigation to maintain optimal growing conditions. A live video feed of the garden is streamed to the Internet, enabling real‑time monitoring from anywhere.
